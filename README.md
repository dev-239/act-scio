### Issues
* Some artifacts are not published by upstream.
  * NLP Models that cannot be found:
    * en-ner-ta.bin (OpenNLP Threat Actor Model)
    * en-ner-vulnerability.bin (OpenNLP Vulnerability Model)
  * Artifacts that are provided but cannot be recreated or updated by users:
    * tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt
    * sectors.cfg
    * tools.cfg
### Configuration
#### Document Handler
There are multiple methods to ingest and handle new documents for processing.
These are defined by the handlers variable in scio-back/doc.
##### Choosing a document handler
You can either define a document handler through the .ini config, or by commandline argument.
There must be a section in the .ini config corresponding to the wanted storage location.

An example would be:
1) Run the application with the commandline argument ```--handler beanstalk```
2) In the .ini configuration have for example the following:
```
[handler-beanstalk]
host = localhost
port = 11300
queue = doc
temp-dir = /var/lib/scio
```

#### Storage
SCIO can store its results to a varied range of locations. The locations are defined 
in the code in the scio-back/storage namespace. A storage location can be anything from
AWS S3, NiFi, Elasticsearch, a folder on the filesystem, Redis, etc.

##### Choosing a storage location
You can either define a storage location through the .ini config, or by commandline argument.
There must be a section in the .ini config corresponding to the wanted storage location.

An example would be:
1) Run the application with the commandline argument ```--storage elasticsearch```
2) In the .ini configuration have for example the following:
```
[storage-elasticsearch]
schema = http
host = 127.0.0.1
port = 9200
index = scio
doc-type = doc
```

#### CLI Options
```
Options:
      --config-file FILE  /etc/scio.ini  Configuration file
      --handler HANDLER   beanstalk      Handler for new documents
      --storage STORAGE   elasticsearch  Storage location for analysis results
